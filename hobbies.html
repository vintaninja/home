					<h3>"ðŸ¤™ Shred the gnar ðŸ¤™"</h3>
					<p> &emsp; Mountain biking gives me a reason to get out of my 
						chair and actually have good physical health.</p>
					<p> &emsp; I usually bike somewhere close like Sunnybrook Park 
						but there have been a few times where I rode with my brother
						all the way to Evergreen Brickworks or the CN Tower.</p>
					<p>  &emsp; Mid-priced bikes were almost all out of stock near the 
						end of 2020 so it looks like a lot of people got into biking
						during lockdown.</p>

					<h2>#2: Guitar</h2>

				<!-- Text -->
				<div class = content_text>
					<h3>"I need nylon strings..."</h3>
					<p> &emsp; I play whatever songs I like so a wide variety of genres: 
						pop, indie, classical, etc. My favourite guitar song is "Stop This Train" 
						by John Mayer who is an awesome guitarist.</p>
					<p> &emsp; Felicidade by Roland Dyens is my second favourite but requires 
						god-tier skills to play.</p>
					<p> &emsp; Classical guitar music is usually the most intriguing, but
						they were played on classical guitars which have nylon strings spaced further apart. 
						Nylon strings would be nice, they're much nicer to fingers than steel strings.</p>

					<h2>#3: Art</h2>

				<!-- Text -->

					<h3>"When was the last time I drew something?"</h3>
					<p> &emsp; I usually don't draw in my free time because there are so many 
						other priorities (eg. sleep, code) but nevertheless I enjoy it.</p>
					<p> &emsp; I'd rather draw objects than faces. I haven't actually 
						practiced drawing faces so that's on my to-do list...</p>
					<p> &emsp; The content I draw is random, from cars to robots to Family Guy. 
						In the summer of 2020, I drew the figure on the right, from the cover of Logic's album  
						Everybody. It's by far the best drawing in my sketchbook. Sam Spratt drew the 
						<a href="https://www.samspratt.com/logic-everybody-album-cover" target="_blank">
						original cover</a> which contains 80 detailed figures.</p>
